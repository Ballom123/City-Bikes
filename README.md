# City-Bikes
Learning to use SQL within Python, some simple queries for data of city bike usage in multiple cities. Bigger focus on relational queries, instead of simple 1 table queries with SQL. 

Test DB was too large to host on github, so a diagram is provided via pdf. Database that was used can be provided by contacting me.
